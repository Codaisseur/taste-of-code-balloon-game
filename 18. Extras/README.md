## EXTRAS

At this point, all participants should have a working MVP game. From here,
everyone will have the better part of an hour to personalize their game.

Hints will cycle throughout the remainder of the presentation for participants
to engage with but coaches will need to be on hand to answer questions. Results
for the extra content can be found in the forthcoming sections. Each extra section
display's the result from the initial MVP state, not in conjunction with the previous
or forthcoming extras.

With that said, the extra content provided in this repo is only there as a guide
and does not necessarily reflect what a participant will want to add, attempt
or alter. Due to the limited time however, it is best to have participants remain
within the confines of the what has been covered, as to manage expectations and to
abuse any one single coach's time & effort.

## Introduction to JavaScript

In this section, participants will be very loosely introduced to JavaScript and
how you can interact with the language via the JavaScript console in the browser.

There won't be an exercise during this section as it is mainly theory, however
participants will likely follow along. The next section will utilize the console
to help explain objects, properties and methods.

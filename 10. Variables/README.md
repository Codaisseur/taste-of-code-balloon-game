##Variables in JavaScript

In this section, participants will be introduced to variables through context and
the application of use via the JavaScript console.

### âœŽ Exercise: Experimenting with variables

Participants will enter the following lines of code one-by-one in the JavaScript
console and observe the results; the intent is to re-enforce how a variable is
declared and subsequently used.

```javascript
var text = "Look at me tast of coding!";
document.write(text);
window.alert(text);

var num1 = 1;
var num2 = 2;
num1 + num2
```

## CSS Padding & Margins

In this section, participants will be introduced to padding and margins.

### âœŽ Exercise: Apply padding and margins to line elements

By the end of this exercise, participants will have a better understanding when
it comes to the forces of padding and margins.

Exercise completion requires participants to create four new classes and apply
one to each line element within their html document. Each class should have a
different background-color and varying padding and margin values to visually
emphasize the difference between these two properties.

The border property will also be included in the example in which participants
will be able to experiment with.

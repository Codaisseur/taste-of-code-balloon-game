# Taste of Code - Balloon Game

### What is the Taste of Code?

Taste of Code is an immersive one-day **beginner** coding workshop with the aim
to get more people involved in code, by impressing upon it's importance in
today's world.

### How does it work?

Participants will build a game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery). Through
a combination of bite size theory and continuous exercise, participants will be
guided to a minimal viable product (MVP) game.

From there, participants will have individual time to take the MVP and make it
their own by customizing and/or adding to the code. Following this, participants
will be shown how to put their game online so they can share it with friends and
family.

### Where you come in...

If you have been directed to this repo then that means you will be coaching at
a Taste of Code event. In this repo you will find the steps and results for this
particular game, in which participants will be guided.

As a coach, you will be on hand to answer questions and assist those that are
stuck. Although we will be covering the very basics of HTML, CSS and jQuery, use
this repo to familiarize yourself with content and end result to be better prepared.

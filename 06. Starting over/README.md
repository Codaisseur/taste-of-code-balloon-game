## Starting Over

Up until this point, participants have covered some of the basics in html and css.
This is all fine and dandy but they are here to build a game!

### âœŽ Exercise: Set up new html file for game

Although this is not an exercise where participants will learn anything new,
completion requires that they:

* Create a new folder on their desktop called `taste_of_code`

* Save a new file in the `taste_of_code` folder via atom called `index.html`

* Set up `index.html` with the basic html skeleton structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```
